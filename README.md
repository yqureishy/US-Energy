* **Purpose of the app:** <br/><br/>
The purpose of the app is to inform the public about United States' Energy data between the years of 2000-2020. The data is split between renewable and non-renewable energy resources. The renewable energy data is limited to solar, wind, geothermal and hydroelectric energy. The renewable energy components display graphs that show energy production and consumption by the United States, a gif to explain how each source is utilized and some pertinent facts about each source. These responsive graphs were designed using Chart.js that allows the user to see the data-point value as they hover over the lines.  The Non-Renewable Energy data displays the crude/petroleum imports/exports as well as the crude production/reserves along with some facts for each data plot.
